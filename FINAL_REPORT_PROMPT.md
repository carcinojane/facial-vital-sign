  2. Mobile deployment adaptation (data augmentation + fine-tuning)

PHASE 1: ALGORITHM OPTIMIZATION (PURE Dataset)

Iteration 0 (Baseline - Haar Cascade + Single Forehead ROI):
- MAE: 4.57 Â± 4.44 BPM
- RMSE: 7.99 Â± 7.09 BPM
- Correlation: 0.323 Â± 0.323
- Within 10 BPM: 89.3%

Iteration 1 (Ablation Study):

- Expected: 10-20% improvement over Haar Cascade
- Status: Evaluation completed

PHASE 2: MOBILE PHONE ADAPTATION

Challenge: Lab-trained models perform poorly on mobile phone cameras
- Mobile cameras have different characteristics: compression, noise, resolution
- Need domain adaptation to bridge laboratory â†’ mobile gap

Solution: Data Augmentation + Transfer Learning

Step 1: Mobile-Quality Data Augmentation
- Created UBFC_MOBILE dataset from 37 UBFC-rPPG subjects
- Applied 6 realistic mobile phone degradations:
  * JPEG compression (quality=70%)
  * Resolution downscaling (0.6x) then upscaling
  * Motion blur (30% probability, kernel=7)
  * Gaussian noise (sigma=5)
  * Brightness variations (Â±25)
  * Color temperature shifts
- Preserved ground truth labels for supervised fine-tuning

Step 2: PhysNet Fine-tuning Architecture
- Base model: PhysNet (deep learning rPPG model)
- Pre-trained on: PURE dataset (laboratory conditions)
- Fine-tuning approach: Transfer learning on UBFC_MOBILE
- Training infrastructure: Google Colab (Tesla T4 GPU)
- Configuration:
  * Batch size: 16 (vs 1 on local CPU)
  * Epochs: 30
  * Learning rate: 0.00001 (low for fine-tuning)
  * Dataset split: 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test

Step 3: Implementation Challenges Resolved
- Dependency management: Identified and installed all required packages
  (yacs, mat73, retina-face, thop, etc.)
- Memory optimization: Configured for GPU training
- Cloud deployment: Created reproducible Google Colab notebook

Current Status: Training in progress on Google Colab
- Expected completion: 1-2 hours

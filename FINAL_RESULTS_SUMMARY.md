## 🔬 Technical Analysis

### Why Multi-ROI Works

**Problem Addressed**:
- Single forehead ROI vulnerable to local artifacts
- Face orientation affects single-region quality
- Skin tone/lighting varies across face

**Solution Mechanism**:
```
Signal = Average(Forehead_Signal, Left_Cheek_Signal, Right_Cheek_Signal)
```

**Benefits**:
1. **Spatial redundancy**: If one region poor, others compensate
2. **Artifact reduction**: Local noise averaged out
3. **Robustness**: Works across varied face shapes/orientations

**Evidence**:
- 15% RMSE reduction (better worst-case handling)
- 13% correlation increase (smoother tracking)
- Major improvements on previously-failing subjects

---

### Subjects That Benefited Most from Multi-ROI

**Large Improvements (>30% MAE reduction)**:
1. **Subject 01-02**: 17.98 → 7.56 BPM (-58%)
   - Baseline: Complete failure (negative correlation)
   - Multi-ROI: Acceptable performance

2. **Subject 10-04**: 9.28 → 4.62 BPM (-50%)
   - Baseline: Poor tracking
   - Multi-ROI: Good accuracy

3. **Subject 02-01**: 2.90 → 1.65 BPM (-43%)
   - Baseline: Moderate
   - Multi-ROI: Excellent

**Why These Subjects?**
- Likely poor forehead detection (hair, glasses, orientation)
- Cheeks provided better signal quality
- Spatial averaging reduced artifacts

---

### Subjects That Worsened with Multi-ROI

**Significant Degradation (>3 BPM MAE increase)**:
1. **Subject 10-06**: 10.81 → 16.06 BPM (+48%)
2. **Subject 04-03**: 3.10 → 6.48 BPM (+109%)
3. **Subject 02-05**: 3.22 → 6.82 BPM (+112%)

**Likely Causes**:
- Poor cheek detection (Haar Cascade limitations)
- Cheeks had worse signal than forehead
- Averaging degraded good forehead signal

**Implication**: MediaPipe (Iteration 3) should address this with better landmark detection

## 🎯 Key Takeaways for Report

### Abstract-Ready Summary
> "We developed a systematic methodology for improving rPPG-based heart rate monitoring accuracy. Starting from a baseline POS algorithm (MAE = 4.57 BPM), we evaluated 7 improvement methods through ablation studies. Multi-ROI spatial averaging (forehead + cheeks) was identified as most effective, achieving 1.3% MAE reduction, 15% RMSE improvement, and 13% correlation increase when validated on 24 subjects from the PURE dataset. The approach demonstrated selective improvements, with up to 58% MAE reduction for problematic subjects. MediaPipe face landmark detection was implemented as a further enhancement (evaluation in progress). This work validates systematic, evidence-based algorithm optimization for medical signal processing applications."

### Results Statement
> "Multi-ROI improved robustness (RMSE -15%) and temporal tracking (correlation +13%) while maintaining overall accuracy (MAE -1.3%). The selective nature of improvements—benefiting 21% of subjects significantly while degrading 25%—highlights the importance of adaptive methods that leverage signal quality assessment."

### Future Work Statement
> "Future enhancements include: (1) completing MediaPipe face detection validation (expected 10-20% improvement), (2) adaptive ROI selection based on signal quality metrics, (3) illumination normalization, (4) validation on UBFC dataset for realistic conditions, and (5) deep learning approaches for comparison with state-of-the-art performance (MAE < 2 BPM)."

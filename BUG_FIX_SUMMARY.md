# Bug Fix Summary: Iteration 2 Evaluation

**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Fixed and re-running

---

## 🐛 Bug Identified

### Root Cause: FPS Mismatch with Frame Skipping

**Problem**: The evaluation scripts (`run_iteration2_evaluation.py`, `run_incremental_evaluation.py`) had an FPS mismatch when using frame skipping for optimization.

**Details**:
- Frame skip = 2 (process every 2nd frame)
- Original FPS = 30
- **Effective FPS = 15** (30 / 2)

**Buggy Code**:
```python
image_files = sorted(image_dir.glob("*.png"))[::frame_skip]  # Skip every 2nd frame
processor = RPPGProcessor(fps=fps, use_multi_roi=use_multi_roi)  # Still fps=30 ❌
```

**Issue**: The processor expected 30 FPS but only received 15 FPS worth of frames. This caused:
- Window size mismatch (expected 300 frames = 10 sec, got 150 frames = 5 sec)
- Incorrect HR estimation (frequency domain calculations off by 2x)
- Invalid results (MAE ~50-70 BPM instead of ~4-5 BPM)

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Corrected FPS Calculation

**Fixed Code**:
```python
image_files = sorted(image_dir.glob("*.png"))[::frame_skip]  # Skip every 2nd frame
# FIXED: Adjust FPS for frame skipping
processor = RPPGProcessor(fps=fps//frame_skip, use_multi_roi=use_multi_roi)  # fps=15 ✅
```

**Line Changed**: `run_iteration2_evaluation.py`, line 54

**Rationale**: When skipping frames, the effective frame rate is `original_fps / frame_skip`. The processor must be told the actual rate it's receiving, not the original capture rate.

## 🔧 Additional Fix: Unicode Encoding

### Problem
Windows console couldn't display Unicode characters (✅, ❌) in the report, causing:
```
UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2705'
```

### Solution
```python
# Save results first
with open('iteration2_comparison.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(report)

# Then try to print (with fallback)
try:
    print("\n" + report)
except UnicodeEncodeError:
    print("\nReport generated (see iteration2_comparison.txt for full details)")
```

**Lines Changed**: `run_iteration2_evaluation.py`, lines 275-283

## 📊 Expected Impact

### Before Fix
- Baseline: MAE ~56 BPM ❌ (Invalid)
- Multi-ROI: MAE ~51 BPM ❌ (Invalid)

### After Fix (Expected)
- Baseline: MAE ~4.57 BPM ✅ (Matches confirmed result)
- Multi-ROI: MAE ~4.0-4.3 BPM ✅ (5-10% improvement expected)

## 🚀 Re-Running Evaluation

**Status**: Currently running in background
**Estimated Time**: 30-40 minutes (24 subjects × 2 configurations)

**Files That Will Be Generated**:
1. `iteration2_comparison.txt` - Before/after comparison report
2. `iteration2_results_*.csv` - Detailed per-subject data

## 🎓 Why This Matters for Your Report

### Technical Rigor

**Shows**:
- Systematic debugging approach
- Understanding of signal processing fundamentals
- Attention to implementation details
- Proper validation methodology

**Report Language** (optional to include):
> "Initial evaluation revealed unexpectedly high MAE values (~50-70 BPM). Root cause analysis identified an FPS mismatch in the frame skipping optimization: the processor was configured for 30 FPS but received frames at effective 15 FPS (every 2nd frame), causing window size and frequency calculation errors. After correction, results aligned with baseline expectations."

**Or Simply**:
> "After validation and correction of FPS parameters for frame skipping optimization, the evaluation was re-run..."

**Benefit**: Demonstrates professional debugging skills!

## 📋 Validation Steps

### How We Confirmed the Bug

1. **Baseline Validation**:
   - `run_pure_evaluation_optimized.py` → MAE = 4.57 BPM ✅
   - Used `fps=fps//frame_skip` (correct)

2. **Bug Detection**:
   - `run_iteration2_evaluation.py` → MAE = 56 BPM ❌
   - Used `fps=fps` (incorrect)

3. **Code Comparison**:
   - Found discrepancy in FPS parameter
   - Identified frame skip not being accounted for

4. **Fix & Re-run**:
   - Updated to `fps=fps//frame_skip`
   - Re-running evaluation with correct parameters

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### Signal Processing Best Practices

1. **Always match processing parameters to actual data rate**
   - If you skip frames, adjust FPS accordingly
   - Window sizes are FPS-dependent

2. **Validate with known baselines**
   - Compare new results against confirmed benchmarks
   - Large discrepancies indicate bugs, not algorithm failure

3. **Document optimization trade-offs**
   - Frame skipping speeds up evaluation 2x
   - Must adjust all time-dependent parameters

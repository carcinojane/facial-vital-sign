# Iteration 3: MediaPipe Implementation - Lessons Learned

**Date**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Critical bug discovered and fixed, re-evaluation in progress
**Phase**: Iteration 3 - Advanced Face Detection

---

## üìã Executive Summary

Iteration 3 initially showed **catastrophic failure** (22% MAE degradation) when implementing MediaPipe Face Mesh. Root cause analysis revealed that the ROI extraction methodology‚Äînot face detection quality‚Äîwas the dominant performance factor. After fixing the implementation to use consistent percentage-based ROIs, re-evaluation is in progress.

## üîç Discovery 1: ROI Consistency More Important Than Face Detection Quality

### Initial Hypothesis (WRONG)
> "MediaPipe's 468-point face mesh will provide 10-20% improvement over Haar Cascade due to more accurate landmark detection."

### Actual Result
**MediaPipe with landmark-based ROIs: 22% WORSE than Haar Cascade**

| Metric | Haar Cascade | MediaPipe (Buggy) | Change |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| MAE | 4.51 BPM | 5.51 BPM | +22.1% WORSE |
| RMSE | 6.79 BPM | 9.65 BPM | +42.2% WORSE |
| Correlation | 0.365 | 0.215 | -41.1% WORSE |

### Root Cause Analysis

**Problem**: Used MediaPipe landmarks to define **irregular polygonal ROIs** instead of **rectangular percentage-based ROIs**.

```python
# WRONG APPROACH (Iteration 3 Initial Implementation)
forehead_points = [10, 67, 109, 10, 338, 297, 332, 338]  # Specific landmarks
forehead_coords = [(int(landmarks[i].x * w), int(landmarks[i].y * h)) for i in forehead_points]
cv2.fillPoly(forehead_mask, [np.array(forehead_coords)], 255)
# Extract irregular polygon region
```

**Issues with this approach:**
1. **Different ROI shapes**: Polygons vs rectangles
2. **Different ROI sizes**: Landmark-based regions much smaller than percentage-based
3. **Different anatomical coverage**: Landmarks don't correspond to same facial areas
4. **Inconsistent spatial averaging**: Three regions don't align with Haar's Multi-ROI approach

### Evidence from Results

**Subjects that WORSENED dramatically (landmark-based ROIs were very different):**
- Subject 01-01: 2.72 ‚Üí 11.30 BPM (315% worse!)
- Subject 10-03: 2.08 ‚Üí 11.39 BPM (447% worse!)
- Subject 02-01: 1.65 ‚Üí 5.82 BPM (253% worse!)

**Subjects that IMPROVED (landmark-based ROIs happened to be better):**
- Subject 10-06: 16.06 ‚Üí 2.75 BPM (83% better!)
- Subject 10-05: 9.52 ‚Üí 4.42 BPM (54% better!)
- Subject 04-03: 6.48 ‚Üí 1.80 BPM (72% better!)

**Interpretation**: The wild variance (+447% to -83%) indicates that ROI selection dominated performance, not face detection accuracy. If face detection quality were the main factor, we'd see consistent improvement or degradation across all subjects.

## üîß Discovery 2: Controlled Variable Testing is Critical

### Lesson Learned
When comparing two methods (Haar vs MediaPipe), you must **isolate the variable you're testing**.

**What We Were Testing**: Face detection quality (Haar Cascade vs MediaPipe Face Mesh)

**What We Should Keep Constant**:
- ROI extraction methodology
- ROI sizes and positions
- Signal processing pipeline
- All other parameters

**What We Accidentally Changed**:
- ‚úó ROI extraction methodology (percentage-based ‚Üí landmark-based)
- ‚úó ROI shapes (rectangles ‚Üí irregular polygons)
- ‚úó ROI sizes (consistent percentages ‚Üí variable landmark regions)
- ‚úó Anatomical coverage (forehead/cheeks ‚Üí different facial areas)

### Scientific Method Violation
This was essentially an **ablation study failure**. We changed multiple variables simultaneously, making it impossible to attribute causation.

**Proper Ablation Study Design:**
```
Iteration 2: [Haar Cascade] + [Percentage-based ROI] + [Multi-ROI averaging]
              ‚Üì Change ONLY face detection ‚Üì
Iteration 3: [MediaPipe]    + [Percentage-based ROI] + [Multi-ROI averaging]
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                              These MUST remain identical!
```

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Fixed Implementation

### Corrected Approach
Use MediaPipe **only for face boundary detection**, then apply **identical percentage-based ROI extraction** as Haar Cascade.

```python
# FIXED APPROACH (Iteration 3 Corrected)
# Step 1: Get accurate face bounding box from MediaPipe landmarks
all_x = [landmarks[i].x for i in range(len(landmarks))]
all_y = [landmarks[i].y for i in range(len(landmarks))]

face_x_min = int(min(all_x) * w)
face_x_max = int(max(all_x) * w)
face_y_min = int(min(all_y) * h)
face_y_max = int(max(all_y) * h)

face_w = face_x_max - face_x_min
face_h = face_y_max - face_y_min

# Step 2: Apply SAME percentage-based ROIs as Haar Cascade
# Forehead: Upper 30% of face, starting 10% from top
forehead_y1 = face_y_min + int(0.1 * face_h)
forehead_y2 = face_y_min + int(0.4 * face_h)
forehead_roi = frame[forehead_y1:forehead_y2, face_x_min:face_x_max]

# Left cheek: 40-70% vertical, 0-40% horizontal
left_y1 = face_y_min + int(0.4 * face_h)
left_y2 = face_y_min + int(0.7 * face_h)
left_x1 = face_x_min
left_x2 = face_x_min + int(0.4 * face_w)
left_cheek_roi = frame[left_y1:left_y2, left_x1:left_x2]

# Right cheek: 40-70% vertical, 60-100% horizontal (same as Haar)
right_y1 = face_y_min + int(0.4 * face_h)
right_y2 = face_y_min + int(0.7 * face_h)
right_x1 = face_x_min + int(0.6 * face_w)
right_x2 = face_x_max
right_cheek_roi = frame[right_y1:right_y2, right_x1:right_x2]
```

### Expected Improvement Mechanism

**MediaPipe Advantage (with fixed ROI extraction):**
1. More accurate face boundary detection (468 landmarks vs simple Haar rectangle)
2. Better handling of face orientation/rotation
3. More robust to lighting variations
4. More precise face localization

**Expected Performance Gain**: 5-15% improvement over Haar Cascade
- Modest because we're only improving face boundary accuracy
- Not dramatic because ROI positioning methodology is now identical

## üìä Discovery 3: The Importance of Baseline Validation

### What Happened
During re-evaluation, Phase 1 (Haar Cascade baseline) produced **identical results** to Iteration 2:
- MAE: 4.51 BPM (matches Iteration 2)
- All 24 subjects have identical MAE values

**Why This Matters:**
This validates that:
1. ‚úÖ Evaluation pipeline is consistent
2. ‚úÖ No regression bugs introduced
3. ‚úÖ Fair comparison between Haar and MediaPipe
4. ‚úÖ Any differences in Phase 2 are attributable to MediaPipe

**Best Practice**: Always re-run baseline in comparative evaluations to ensure consistency.

## üß™ Discovery 4: Installation Issues with Python 3.13

### Problem Encountered
MediaPipe doesn't have pre-built wheels for Python 3.13 (released Oct 2024).

```bash
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mediapipe (from versions: none)
```

### Solution
1. Found Python 3.12 installation on system (`python3.12`)
2. Installed MediaPipe in Python 3.12 user environment
3. Installed missing dependencies (scikit-learn, pandas)
4. All evaluations now use `python3.12` explicitly

### Lesson
**Dependency management is critical**:
- Check library compatibility with Python version before starting
- Document exact Python version used for reproducibility
- Consider using conda environments (as documented in project setup)

---

## üìà Discovery 5: Subject-Level Analysis Reveals Implementation Issues

### How We Detected the Bug

Looking at **subject-level variance** immediately revealed the problem:

**Normal improvement pattern** (e.g., Multi-ROI in Iteration 2):
- 5/24 improved significantly
- 6/24 worsened slightly
- 13/24 similar
- **Variance explanation**: Some subjects benefit from spatial averaging, others don't

**Abnormal pattern** (MediaPipe with wrong ROIs):
- Wild swings: +447%, -83%, +315%, -72%
- No consistent direction
- **Variance explanation**: ROI positioning is random/inconsistent

**Lesson**: When overall metrics look bad, drill down to subject-level analysis to understand why.

---

## üî¨ Discovery 6: Negative Results Are Valuable

### Initial Reaction (WRONG)
> "MediaPipe failed. Let's try something else."

### Proper Scientific Approach (RIGHT)
> "MediaPipe showed 22% degradation. Let's understand WHY before abandoning it."

**Investigation Process:**
1. Check if MediaPipe was actually running (was it using fallback?)
2. Verify installation (`python -c "import mediapipe"`)
3. Analyze subject-level results for patterns
4. Compare ROI extraction code between Haar and MediaPipe
5. Identify root cause (inconsistent ROI methodology)
6. Fix implementation
7. Re-evaluate

**Outcome**: Turned a "failed" iteration into a **valuable lesson** about controlled variable testing.

## üìù Code Changes Summary

### File Modified
`scripts/simple_rppg_ui.py` - Lines 100-171

### Before (BUGGY)
```python
def _extract_mediapipe_roi(self, frame):
    # Extract irregular polygonal regions based on specific landmarks
    forehead_points = [10, 67, 109, 10, 338, 297, 332, 338]
    forehead_coords = [(int(landmarks[i].x * w), int(landmarks[i].y * h))
                       for i in forehead_points]
    cv2.fillPoly(forehead_mask, [np.array(forehead_coords)], 255)
    # ... similar for cheeks
```

**Lines of code**: ~85 lines
**Approach**: Landmark-based polygonal ROIs
**Result**: 22% degradation

### After (FIXED)
```python
def _extract_mediapipe_roi(self, frame):
    # Get face bounding box from MediaPipe
    face_x_min = int(min(all_x) * w)
    face_x_max = int(max(all_x) * w)
    face_y_min = int(min(all_y) * h)
    face_y_max = int(max(all_y) * h)

    # Apply SAME percentage-based ROIs as Haar
    forehead_y1 = face_y_min + int(0.1 * face_h)
    forehead_y2 = face_y_min + int(0.4 * face_h)
    forehead_roi = frame[forehead_y1:forehead_y2, face_x_min:face_x_max]
    # ... similar for cheeks with SAME percentages
```

**Lines of code**: ~71 lines
**Approach**: Percentage-based rectangular ROIs (matches Haar)
**Result**: Expected 5-15% improvement (evaluation in progress)

### Documentation Added
```python
"""ITERATION 3 (FIXED): Extract ROI using MediaPipe with percentage-based regions

Uses MediaPipe for accurate face detection, then applies SAME percentage-based
ROI extraction as Haar Cascade to ensure consistent comparison.
"""
```

## üéì Key Lessons for Future Iterations

### 1. Isolate Variables in Ablation Studies
**Rule**: When testing improvement X, change ONLY the component related to X.

**Example**:
- Testing face detection quality? Keep ROI extraction identical.
- Testing ROI selection strategy? Keep face detection identical.
- Testing signal processing? Keep face detection and ROI identical.

### 2. Subject-Level Analysis is Essential
**Don't just look at**:
- Overall MAE/RMSE/correlation

**Also analyze**:
- Distribution of improvements vs degradations
- Magnitude of variance (small changes vs wild swings)
- Patterns (which subjects improve/worsen and why)

### 3. Validate Baseline Consistency
**Before comparing**:
- Re-run baseline with new code
- Verify results match previous iteration
- Ensures fair comparison

### 4. Negative Results ‚Üí Investigation, Not Abandonment
**When results are bad**:
1. ‚úÖ Investigate root cause
2. ‚úÖ Check for implementation bugs
3. ‚úÖ Analyze subject-level patterns
4. ‚úÖ Verify controlled variables
5. ‚úó Don't immediately abandon the approach

### 5. Document Expected Improvement Mechanisms
**Before implementing**:
- State hypothesis clearly
- Identify expected improvement magnitude
- Explain mechanism (why should this help?)
- Define what would constitute success/failure

**After results**:
- Compare actual vs expected
- If mismatch, investigate why
- Update understanding based on findings

## üìä Expected Final Results

### Hypothesis (FIXED Implementation)
MediaPipe with percentage-based ROIs should show **5-15% improvement** over Haar Cascade.

### Reasoning
**Improvement sources**:
1. More accurate face bounding box (468 landmarks vs simple rectangle)
2. Better handling of face orientation
3. More robust to partial occlusions (hair, glasses)
4. Consistent across varied face shapes

**Limited magnitude because**:
- ROI positioning methodology now identical
- Only improving face boundary accuracy
- PURE dataset has controlled conditions (less room for improvement)

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ **Success**: 5-15% MAE reduction, positive correlation change
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Marginal**: 0-5% improvement (MediaPipe overhead not worth benefit)
- ‚ùå **Failure**: Any degradation (would indicate additional bugs)

## üöÄ Next Steps After Iteration 3 Completes

### If Results Show Improvement (5-15%)
1. Update `FINAL_RESULTS_SUMMARY.md` with Iteration 3 actual results
2. Update `CLAUDE_REPORT_PROMPT_UPDATED.md` with complete 3-iteration story
3. Document MediaPipe as validated improvement
4. Recommend MediaPipe for production deployment

### If Results Show No Improvement (0-5%)
1. Document that face detection quality is not limiting factor
2. Focus future improvements on other areas:
   - Illumination normalization
   - Adaptive bandpass filtering
   - Temporal smoothing (Kalman filter)
   - Adaptive ROI selection based on signal quality

### If Results Still Show Degradation
1. Further investigation needed
2. Possible additional bugs in implementation
3. May need to visualize ROIs to verify correct extraction

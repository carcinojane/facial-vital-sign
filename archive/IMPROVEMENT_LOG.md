## üîÑ Iteration History

### **ITERATION 0: Baseline Implementation**
**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

#### Motivation
Establish baseline performance using standard POS (Plane-Orthogonal-to-Skin) algorithm before any optimizations.

#### Implementation Details
```
Algorithm: POS (Wang et al., 2017)
Face Detection: OpenCV Haar Cascade
ROI: Forehead only (upper 40% of detected face)
Window Size: 300 frames (10 seconds at 30 FPS)
Bandpass Filter: 0.7-3.0 Hz (42-180 BPM)
Signal Processing:
  - RGB normalization (mean/std)
  - POS projection (R-G, R+G-2B)
  - Butterworth bandpass (4th order)
  - FFT peak detection
```

#### Hypothesis
The standard POS algorithm should provide a reasonable baseline, with expected MAE in the 3-5 BPM range based on literature.

#### Results
**Dataset**: PURE (24 subjects, image sequences)

| Metric | Value | Std Dev |
|--------|-------|---------|
| MAE | 4.57 BPM | ¬± 4.44 BPM |
| RMSE | 7.99 BPM | ¬± 7.09 BPM |
| MAPE | 6.20% | ¬± 5.62% |
| Correlation | 0.323 | ¬± 0.323 |
| Within 5 BPM | 82.4% | ¬± 20.8% |
| Within 10 BPM | 89.3% | ¬± 16.0% |

**Best Subjects** (MAE < 2 BPM):
- 03-04: MAE = 0.91 BPM, r = 0.381
- 03-02: MAE = 1.21 BPM, r = 0.489
- 03-01: MAE = 1.24 BPM, r = 0.528
- 01-03: MAE = 1.41 BPM, r = 0.621

**Worst Subjects** (MAE > 9 BPM):
- 01-02: MAE = 17.98 BPM, r = -0.526
- 02-02: MAE = 12.89 BPM, r = -0.105
- 10-06: MAE = 10.81 BPM, r = 0.559
- 04-02: MAE = 9.54 BPM, r = 0.044
- 10-04: MAE = 9.28 BPM, r = 0.437

#### Analysis
‚úÖ **Strengths**:
- 11/24 subjects achieve excellent results (MAE < 3 BPM)
- 89.3% of predictions within clinically acceptable 10 BPM range
- Algorithm works reliably for stationary subjects with good lighting

‚ö†Ô∏è **Weaknesses**:
1. **High variance** (¬±4.44 BPM) - inconsistent across subjects
2. **Low correlation** (r = 0.323) - poor HR tracking over time
3. **Poor performance on 5 subjects** - indicates robustness issues
4. **Negative correlations** - algorithm completely fails for some subjects

#### Root Cause Analysis
Based on subject-by-subject analysis:
1. **Single ROI limitation**: Forehead-only may be suboptimal for some face shapes/orientations
2. **Face detection failures**: Haar cascade may miss or poorly locate faces
3. **Lighting sensitivity**: No illumination normalization
4. **Motion artifacts**: No motion detection/filtering
5. **Rigid bandpass filter**: 0.7-3.0 Hz may be too restrictive for some subjects

#### Conclusions
Baseline performance is **acceptable for proof-of-concept** but **below published benchmarks**. The high variance suggests systematic improvements could yield significant gains.

#### Next Steps
Test 7 improvement methods individually to identify most effective enhancements:
1. Motion filtering
2. Multi-ROI (forehead + cheeks)
3. Signal detrending
4. Adaptive bandpass filtering
5. Temporal smoothing
6. Outlier rejection
7. Quality assessment

### **ITERATION 1: Exploratory Testing - 7 Improvement Methods**
**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

#### Motivation
Before committing to a specific improvement path, systematically test multiple enhancement strategies to identify which methods provide the most significant gains.

#### Methodology: Ablation Study
- **Test set**: 10 subjects from PURE dataset
- **Approach**: Enable each method individually while keeping all others disabled
- **Baseline comparison**: Same 10 subjects with no improvements
- **Metrics tracked**: MAE, RMSE, Correlation, Within-10-BPM%

#### Methods Tested

##### 1. Motion Filtering
**Hypothesis**: Frames with significant motion introduce artifacts that degrade HR estimation.

**Implementation**:
- Frame-to-frame difference calculation
- Motion threshold: 15 (grayscale difference)
- Skip frames exceeding threshold

**Results**: MAE = 56.77 BPM (no change from baseline: 56.77 BPM)

**Analysis**: ‚ùå **No improvement**
PURE dataset subjects are relatively stationary. Motion artifacts are not a significant issue in this dataset.

**Decision**: Do not implement for PURE dataset. May be valuable for real-time webcam applications.

---

##### 2. Multi-ROI (Forehead + Both Cheeks)
**Hypothesis**: Using multiple facial regions provides more robust signal averaging and reduces dependence on single-region quality.

**Implementation**:
- ROI 1: Forehead (upper 30% of face)
- ROI 2: Left cheek (40-70% vertical, 0-40% horizontal)
- ROI 3: Right cheek (40-70% vertical, 60-100% horizontal)
- Signal: Average RGB values across all three ROIs

**Results**: MAE = 50.89 BPM vs baseline 56.77 BPM

**Improvement**: -5.88 BPM (-10.4% reduction) ‚úÖ

**Analysis**: üèÜ **BEST SINGLE METHOD**
Multi-ROI significantly improves robustness by:
- Reducing impact of local shadows/reflections
- Providing redundancy if one region has poor signal
- Better spatial averaging of blood volume changes

**Decision**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENT** - Most effective single improvement

---

##### 3. Signal Detrending
**Hypothesis**: Low-frequency trends (lighting changes, etc.) contaminate the HR signal.

**Implementation**:
- Scipy detrend() - removes linear trends
- Applied after POS projection, before filtering

**Results**: MAE = 56.76 BPM vs baseline 56.77 BPM

**Improvement**: -0.01 BPM (negligible)

**Analysis**: ‚ùå **Minimal impact**
Bandpass filtering already removes low frequencies effectively. Additional detrending provides no benefit.

**Decision**: Skip - Adds complexity without gain

---

##### 4. Adaptive Bandpass Filtering
**Hypothesis**: Standard 0.7-3.0 Hz range may be too restrictive. Wider range captures edge cases.

**Implementation**:
- Wider range: 0.5-3.5 Hz (30-210 BPM)
- Same 4th-order Butterworth design

**Results**: MAE = 56.26 BPM vs baseline 56.77 BPM

**Improvement**: -0.51 BPM (-0.9%) ‚úÖ

**Analysis**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Slight improvement**
Marginal benefit. May help subjects with unusual HR ranges but minimal impact overall.

**Decision**: Low priority - Consider in combination

---

##### 5. Temporal Smoothing
**Hypothesis**: Smoothing HR estimates over time reduces noise in final output.

**Implementation**:
- Median filter over last 5 estimates
- Deque buffer of recent HR values

**Results**: MAE = 56.61 BPM vs baseline 56.77 BPM

**Improvement**: -0.16 BPM (negligible)

**Analysis**: ‚ùå **Minimal impact**
Small reduction in noise but doesn't address core signal quality issues.

**Decision**: Low priority - May help for real-time display

---

##### 6. Outlier Rejection
**Hypothesis**: Rejecting abnormal estimates (>20 BPM from median) prevents spurious predictions.

**Implementation**:
- Track median of last 10 estimates
- Reject if |current - median| > 20 BPM
- Return median instead

**Results**: MAE = 56.77 BPM (no change from baseline)

**Improvement**: None

**Analysis**: ‚ùå **No effect**
May be too conservative. Subjects with genuinely changing HR are rejected.

**Decision**: Skip - Needs more sophisticated approach

---

##### 7. Quality Assessment (SNR)
**Hypothesis**: Weighting estimates by signal quality improves reliability.

**Implementation**:
- Calculate SNR (peak power / mean power in HR band)
- Track quality score per estimate

**Results**: MAE = Not separately testable (requires integration with other methods)

**Analysis**: üí° **Supportive feature**
Useful for debugging and confidence scoring but doesn't directly improve accuracy alone.

**Decision**: Implement as diagnostic tool

#### Summary of Individual Method Testing

| Method | MAE Change | % Improvement | Priority |
|--------|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Multi-ROI** | **-5.88 BPM** | **-10.4%** | üèÜ **HIGH** |
| Adaptive Bandpass | -0.51 BPM | -0.9% | MEDIUM |
| Temporal Smoothing | -0.16 BPM | -0.3% | LOW |
| Detrending | -0.01 BPM | 0% | ‚ùå SKIP |
| Motion Filtering | 0 BPM | 0% | ‚ùå SKIP |
| Outlier Rejection | 0 BPM | 0% | ‚ùå SKIP |

---

#### Cumulative Testing Results

##### Best Two Methods Combined
**Configuration**: Multi-ROI + Adaptive Bandpass
**Results**: MAE = 49.90 BPM
**Improvement**: -6.87 BPM (-12.1%) ‚úÖ

##### All Methods Combined
**Configuration**: All 7 methods enabled
**Results**: MAE = 50.82 BPM
**Improvement**: -5.95 BPM (-10.5%)

**Finding**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Diminishing returns with too many methods**
Adding all methods actually performs worse than Best Two. Likely interference between methods.

---

#### Key Findings from Iteration 1

1. ‚úÖ **Multi-ROI is the clear winner** - 10.4% improvement alone
2. ‚úÖ **Combining Multi-ROI + Adaptive BP gives best results** - 12.1% improvement
3. ‚ùå **Motion filtering, detrending, and outlier rejection are ineffective** for PURE dataset
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **More methods ‚â† better results** - Feature interactions matter
5. üí° **Dataset-specific tuning is critical** - What works depends on data characteristics

---

#### Conclusions & Next Actions

**Decision**: Implement **Multi-ROI** as Iteration 2
**Rationale**:
- Largest single improvement (10.4%)
- Simple to implement
- Well-understood mechanism
- Low computational cost

**Expected Impact**:
- Baseline: MAE = 4.57 BPM
- After Multi-ROI: MAE ‚âà 4.09 BPM (estimated 10.4% improvement)

**Validation Plan**:
- Re-run full 24-subject evaluation
- Compare with Iteration 0 baseline
- Analyze which subjects improved most
- Document any subjects that got worse

---

### **ITERATION 2: Multi-ROI Implementation**
**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: üîÑ In Progress

#### Motivation
Based on Iteration 1 findings, Multi-ROI showed the strongest improvement. Implementing this in the main system should yield consistent accuracy gains across all subjects.

#### Implementation Plan

1. **Update `simple_rppg_ui.py`**:
   - Modify `extract_face_roi()` to return 3 regions
   - Update `extract_rgb_signal()` to average across regions
   - Maintain backward compatibility

2. **Key Changes**:
```python
# OLD: Single forehead ROI
forehead_roi = frame[forehead_y:forehead_y + h, x:x + w]

# NEW: Three ROIs
forehead_roi = frame[y + int(h*0.1):y + int(h*0.4), x:x + w]
left_cheek = frame[y + int(h*0.4):y + int(h*0.7), x:x + int(w*0.4)]
right_cheek = frame[y + int(h*0.4):y + int(h*0.7), x + int(w*0.6):x + w]

# Average RGB across all three
rois = [forehead_roi, left_cheek, right_cheek]
rgb_values = [np.mean(roi) for roi in rois]
mean_rgb = np.mean(rgb_values, axis=0)
```

3. **Testing**:
   - Run `run_pure_evaluation_optimized.py` with updated code
   - Compare results with Iteration 0 baseline
   - Generate before/after comparison report

#### Expected Results
- **Target MAE**: ~4.09 BPM (10.4% improvement from 4.57 BPM)
- **Target Correlation**: > 0.40 (improvement from 0.323)
- **Subjects expected to improve most**: Those with poor forehead signal quality

#### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ MAE reduces by at least 8%
- ‚úÖ No subject gets worse by more than 1 BPM
- ‚úÖ Correlation coefficient improves
- ‚úÖ System remains real-time capable (30 FPS)

## üéØ Lessons Learned

### Iteration 0 ‚Üí 1
1. **Systematic testing beats intuition** - Motion filtering seemed important but had zero impact
2. **Simple improvements can be most effective** - Multi-ROI is conceptually simple but highly effective
3. **Dataset characteristics matter** - PURE has minimal motion, so motion filtering is useless
4. **Measure, don't assume** - Empirical testing revealed unexpected results

### Iteration 1 ‚Üí 2
1. **Validate on full dataset** - 10-subject testing may not generalize
2. **Document reasoning** - Clear hypothesis ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí results cycle
3. **One change at a time** - Easier to attribute improvements
4. **Keep baseline frozen** - Always compare against same reference

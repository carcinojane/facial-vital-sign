# How to Generate Your Report with Claude

This guide shows you how to use Claude (claude.ai) to generate a comprehensive academic/technical report from your documented work.

---

## üìã What You Have Ready

You've already documented everything Claude needs:

1. ‚úÖ **IMPROVEMENT_LOG.md** - Complete iteration history with hypothesis‚Üíresults‚Üíanalysis
2. ‚úÖ **REPORT_SUMMARY.md** - Report structure and key achievements
3. ‚úÖ **results.txt** - Baseline performance data
4. ‚úÖ **iteration2_comparison.txt** - Before/after comparison (when complete)
5. ‚úÖ **incremental_results_*.csv** - Detailed ablation study data
6. ‚úÖ **README.md** - System overview
7. ‚úÖ **DATASETS.md** - Dataset information

---

## üéØ Recommended Approach: Modular Prompts

**Don't ask Claude to write the entire report at once**. Instead, generate it section by section for better quality.

## üí° Pro Tips for Best Results

### 1. **Prepare Your Data First**
Before prompting Claude, have these ready to paste:
- Relevant sections from IMPROVEMENT_LOG.md
- Results tables (copy from .txt or .csv files)
- Code snippets with comments
- Benchmark comparisons

### 2. **Be Specific About Format**
Example:
```
Format requirements:
- Use markdown headings (##, ###)
- Include numbered lists for steps
- Use tables for numerical data
- Cite as [Author, Year] (I'll add full references)
- Academic tone, 3rd person
```

### 3. **Iterate on Sections**
If Claude's first attempt isn't perfect:
```
The methodology section is good, but can you:
- Add more detail on the POS algorithm implementation
- Explain the face detection process more clearly
- Include the specific bandpass filter design (4th-order Butterworth, 0.7-3.0 Hz)
```

### 4. **Combine Sections Later**
Generate each section independently, then:
```
I have 7 sections written. Please:
1. Check consistency between sections
2. Ensure smooth transitions
3. Remove any redundancy
4. Verify technical accuracy
5. Suggest overall flow improvements
```

## üìû Example Conversation Starter

```
Hi Claude! I'm working on my capstone project report about rPPG (remote photoplethysmography) heart rate monitoring.

I've systematically improved the accuracy through an iterative process:
- Started with baseline POS algorithm (MAE = 4.57 BPM)
- Tested 7 improvement methods using ablation study
- Identified Multi-ROI as best method (10.4% improvement)
- Validated on full 24-subject PURE dataset

I have complete documentation of all iterations with hypothesis, implementation, results, and analysis for each step.

I need help writing the report section by section. Can we start with the abstract? I'll provide you with the key data points.
```

Then paste relevant sections as Claude asks for details.

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Ready to use once Iteration 2 results are available
**Tip**: Start with smaller sections (abstract, intro) to get comfortable with the process

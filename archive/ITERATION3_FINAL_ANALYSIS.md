### Overall Performance

| Metric | Haar Cascade (Iteration 2) | MediaPipe (Fixed) | Change | Verdict |

## üîç Key Discovery: Face Detection Quality is NOT the Limiting Factor

### Hypothesis (WRONG)
> "MediaPipe's 468-point face mesh will provide more accurate face boundaries, leading to 5-15% improvement in heart rate estimation accuracy."

### Actual Result
MediaPipe showed **10.5% degradation** even with percentage-based ROIs matching Haar Cascade.

### **Why This Discovery is Important**

This result tells us that **face detection accuracy is NOT a bottleneck** for rPPG performance on the PURE dataset. The Haar Cascade's simple rectangular face detection is "good enough" - more sophisticated face detection doesn't help because:

1. **PURE dataset characteristics**:
   - Controlled lighting
   - Frontal face orientation
   - Minimal head movement
   - High-quality images

2. **Haar Cascade is sufficient** for these conditions - faces are already well-detected

3. **MediaPipe's advantage doesn't matter** when faces are already easy to detect

## üß™ Deep Dive: Why Did MediaPipe Perform Worse?

### Analysis of Subject-Level Results

**Dramatic Worsening (>5 BPM increase)**:
- Subject 01-02: 7.56 ‚Üí 14.06 BPM (+86%)
- Subject 04-01: 2.05 ‚Üí 13.63 BPM (+565%!)
- Subject 02-02: 13.23 ‚Üí 21.63 BPM (+63%)
- Subject 03-01: 1.17 ‚Üí 6.64 BPM (+467%)
- Subject 02-05: 6.82 ‚Üí 9.37 BPM (+37%)

**Dramatic Improvement (>4 BPM decrease)**:
- Subject 10-06: 16.06 ‚Üí 1.36 BPM (-91%)
- Subject 10-05: 9.52 ‚Üí 5.16 BPM (-46%)
- Subject 04-03: 6.48 ‚Üí 1.84 BPM (-72%)

### **Root Cause Hypothesis**: Face Boundary Differences

Even with percentage-based ROIs, MediaPipe and Haar produce **different face bounding boxes**:

1. **Haar Cascade**: Returns rectangular region from face detector
   - Includes some background/hair
   - Consistent padding around face
   - Simple, stable boundaries

2. **MediaPipe**: Computes bounding box from 468 landmarks
   ```python
   face_x_min = int(min(all_x) * w)  # Tightest possible bound
   face_x_max = int(max(all_x) * w)
   ```
   - **Tighter** face boundaries (excludes background)
   - More **variable** boundaries (landmark-dependent)
   - More **sensitive** to face orientation

### **Impact of Tighter Boundaries**

When MediaPipe's bounding box is **tighter** than Haar:
- ROI percentages apply to a **smaller base area**
- Forehead ROI might be **too small** or in wrong location
- Cheek ROIs might miss optimal signal regions

**Example**:
```
Haar Cascade:
  Face width: 200px (includes some padding)
  Forehead ROI: 0-200px horizontal ‚Üí covers full forehead

MediaPipe:
  Face width: 160px (tight to landmarks)
  Forehead ROI: 0-160px horizontal ‚Üí misses edges of forehead
```

## üìà Evidence from Specific Cases

### Case Study 1: Subject 04-01 (Catastrophic Failure)

- **Haar MAE**: 2.05 BPM (good)
- **MediaPipe MAE**: 13.63 BPM (terrible - 565% worse!)

**Hypothesis**: MediaPipe's face boundary excluded critical forehead/cheek regions where pulse signal was strong.

### Case Study 2: Subject 10-06 (Dramatic Success)

- **Haar MAE**: 16.06 BPM (terrible)
- **MediaPipe MAE**: 1.36 BPM (excellent - 91% better!)

**Hypothesis**: Haar's face detection was poor (wrong location/size), MediaPipe corrected it and found proper ROIs.

### **Overall Pattern**

The **wild variance** in subject-level changes (+565%, -91%) indicates that MediaPipe's face boundaries are **inconsistently better or worse** than Haar's, not systematically better.

## üí° Interpretation: What This Means

### 1. Haar Cascade is "Good Enough"

For controlled conditions like PURE dataset:
- Simple Haar Cascade face detection is adequate
- More sophisticated detection doesn't improve rPPG accuracy
- **Don't invest effort in better face detection for controlled scenarios**

### 2. Face Boundary Precision Matters MORE Than Expected

Even with identical percentage-based ROI methodology:
- Small differences in face bounding box location/size significantly impact results
- MediaPipe's tighter boundaries can be **too tight**
- Some padding/margin around face may actually be beneficial

### 3. ROI Selection is the Dominant Factor

**Rank of importance** (from this study):
1. **ROI selection methodology** (percentage-based vs landmark-based) - HUGE impact
2. **Face boundary accuracy** (size/position of bounding box) - MODERATE impact
3. **Face detection method** (Haar vs MediaPipe) - NEGLIGIBLE direct impact

### 4. Dataset Characteristics Matter

MediaPipe might still help in:
- **Realistic conditions** (UBFC dataset with varied lighting/orientation)
- **Challenging scenarios** (partial occlusions, extreme angles)
- **Motion-heavy videos** (where Haar might lose tracking)

But for **controlled laboratory conditions**, Haar is sufficient.

## üéì Lessons Learned (Updated)

### Lesson 1: Negative Results Have High Value

**This "failed" iteration taught us:**
1. Face detection quality is not the limiting factor (valuable insight!)
2. ROI methodology is more important than face detection accuracy
3. Face bounding box size/position matters more than detection sophistication
4. Controlled datasets don't benefit from advanced face detection

### Lesson 2: Hypothesis Testing is Working

**Scientific method validated:**
- We had a clear hypothesis (MediaPipe will improve accuracy)
- We tested it properly (controlled variables after fixing bugs)
- We got a clear answer (NO improvement, face detection not limiting factor)
- We learned something valuable (focus elsewhere for improvements)

### Lesson 3: Don't Assume "Better" Components ‚Üí Better System

**MediaPipe is objectively better at face detection:**
- 468 landmarks vs simple rectangle
- More accurate facial feature localization
- Better handling of varied poses

**But it doesn't improve rPPG performance** because:
- Face detection accuracy isn't the bottleneck
- Tighter face boundaries can hurt ROI selection
- "Better" in one context ‚â† "better" in another application

## üöÄ Implications for Future Work

### What TO Focus On (High Impact)

Based on Iteration 3 findings, these are more promising:

1. **Illumination Normalization**
   - Likely higher impact than face detection improvements
   - Addresses actual data quality issues
   - Should help across all subjects

2. **Adaptive ROI Selection**
   - Choose ROIs based on signal quality metrics (SNR, correlation)
   - More impactful than better face detection
   - Addresses subject-specific optimal regions

3. **Signal Processing Improvements**
   - Adaptive bandpass filtering (subject-specific HR range)
   - Temporal smoothing (Kalman filter)
   - Better detrending methods
   - Direct improvements to signal quality

4. **UBFC Dataset Validation**
   - Test if current Multi-ROI approach generalizes
   - Realistic lighting conditions might reveal different limiting factors
   - May discover that face detection matters more in challenging conditions

### What NOT to Focus On (Low Impact)

1. ‚ùå **More sophisticated face detection** (MediaPipe, DLib, etc.)
   - Iteration 3 showed no benefit
   - Adds computational cost
   - Not the limiting factor

2. ‚ùå **Face landmark-based ROIs** (using specific anatomical points)
   - Iteration 3 (buggy version) showed this performs worse
   - More complexity without benefit
   - Percentage-based approach is simpler and better

## üéØ For Capstone Report

### How to Present Iteration 3

**‚úÖ GOOD Framing (Honest, Scientific)**:

> "Iteration 3 evaluated MediaPipe Face Mesh (468 landmarks) as an improvement over Haar Cascade face detection. After correcting an initial implementation bug related to ROI extraction methodology, comprehensive evaluation on 24 subjects showed that MediaPipe provided no performance improvement (MAE: 4.51 ‚Üí 4.99 BPM, +10.5% degradation). This negative result yielded a valuable insight: **face detection quality is not a limiting factor for rPPG accuracy in controlled laboratory conditions**. The finding validates that Haar Cascade is sufficient for the PURE dataset and redirects future optimization efforts toward signal processing and illumination normalization, which are more likely to provide meaningful improvements."

**‚ùå BAD Framing (Dishonest)**:

> "We also tried MediaPipe but it didn't work, so we went back to Haar Cascade."

### Key Messages

1. **Methodology was rigorous** (ablation study, bug fixing, re-evaluation)
2. **Negative result is valuable** (redirects future work appropriately)
3. **Scientific approach validated** (hypothesis ‚Üí test ‚Üí conclusion ‚Üí learning)
4. **Demonstrates maturity** (not hiding failures, learning from them)

### Discussion Points

**For Discussion chapter**:
- Why MediaPipe failed despite being "better" face detector
- Importance of matching algorithm improvements to actual bottlenecks
- Dataset characteristics determine which improvements matter
- Simpler solutions can outperform complex ones in appropriate contexts

**For Future Work chapter**:
- Focus on signal processing improvements (higher ROI)
- Illumination normalization more promising than face detection
- Adaptive ROI selection based on signal quality
- UBFC validation to test generalization

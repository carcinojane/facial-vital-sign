##  📊 Key Results

### Baseline (Iteration 0)
**Algorithm**: POS with single forehead ROI

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| MAE | 4.57 ± 4.44 BPM |
| RMSE | 7.99 ± 7.09 BPM |
| Correlation | 0.323 ± 0.323 |
| Within 10 BPM | 89.3% |

**Analysis**:
- ✅ Works well for 11/24 subjects (MAE < 3 BPM)
- ❌ High variance indicates robustness issues
- ❌ Low correlation suggests poor HR tracking
- ❌ Below published benchmarks

### Ablation Study (Iteration 1)
**Tested Methods** (10 subjects):

| Method | MAE Impact | Decision |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Multi-ROI** | **-10.4%** | ✅ **Implement** |
| Adaptive Bandpass | -0.9% | Consider later |
| Temporal Smoothing | -0.3% | Low priority |
| Motion Filtering | 0% | Skip (dataset-specific) |
| Detrending | 0% | Skip (redundant) |
| Outlier Rejection | 0% | Skip (ineffective) |

**Key Finding**: Multi-ROI provides largest single improvement by averaging signal across multiple facial regions (forehead + both cheeks).

### Iteration 2: Multi-ROI Implementation
**Status**: [Awaiting results from `run_iteration2_evaluation.py`]

**Expected**:
- MAE: ~4.09 BPM (10% improvement)
- Improved robustness for subjects with poor forehead signal
- Better spatial averaging reduces local artifact impact

---

## 💡 Technical Insights

### Why Multi-ROI Works

**Problem**: Single forehead ROI is vulnerable to:
- Local shadows/reflections
- Face orientation changes
- Skin tone variations
- Local motion artifacts

**Solution**: Average across three regions:
1. Forehead (upper 30%)
2. Left cheek (mid-face, left 40%)
3. Right cheek (mid-face, right 40%)

**Mechanism**:
- Blood volume changes are global (whole face)
- Local artifacts are isolated (single region)
- Averaging emphasizes signal, suppresses noise
- Redundancy if one region has poor detection

### Methods That Didn't Work (And Why)

**Motion Filtering**:
- Assumption: Motion artifacts degrade signal
- Reality: PURE subjects are stationary
- Lesson: Dataset characteristics matter

**Detrending**:
- Assumption: Additional trend removal helps
- Reality: Bandpass filter already handles this
- Lesson: Avoid redundant processing

**Outlier Rejection**:
- Assumption: Filtering spurious estimates improves MAE
- Reality: Threshold too conservative, rejects valid changes
- Lesson: Simple rules can't distinguish noise from signal

## 📈 Comparison with State-of-the-Art

| Method | MAE (BPM) | Correlation | Year |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Our Baseline** | 4.57 | 0.323 | 2025 |
| **Our Multi-ROI** | [TBD] | [TBD] | 2025 |
| POS (Original) | 2-3 | 0.85-0.90 | 2017 |
| CHROM | 2.5 | 0.80-0.85 | 2013 |
| PhysNet (DL) | 1.5 | 0.90-0.95 | 2019 |

**Gap Analysis**:
- Our baseline is below published POS benchmarks
- Potential reasons:
  - Different preprocessing
  - Face detection quality (Haar vs better methods)
  - No illumination normalization
  - Simplified implementation
- Multi-ROI improvement addresses spatial averaging deficiency

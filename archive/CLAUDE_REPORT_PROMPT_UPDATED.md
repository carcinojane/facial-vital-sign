I'm writing a capstone project report on rPPG (remote photoplethysmography) heart rate monitoring with systematic improvement methodology.

PROJECT SUMMARY:
- Built contactless heart rate monitoring system using facial video analysis
- Dataset: PURE (24 subjects, controlled laboratory conditions)
- Systematic approach: Baseline ‚Üí Ablation study ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Validation

COMPLETE RESULTS:

Iteration 0 (Baseline - Haar Cascade + Single Forehead ROI):
- MAE: 4.57 ¬± 4.44 BPM
- RMSE: 7.99 ¬± 7.09 BPM
- Correlation: 0.323 ¬± 0.323
- Within 10 BPM: 89.3%
- Performance: 11/24 subjects excellent (MAE < 3 BPM), 5/24 poor (MAE > 9 BPM)
- Analysis: High variance indicates robustness issues, low correlation suggests tracking problems

Iteration 1 (Ablation Study):
- Tested 7 improvement methods independently on 10-subject subset
- Methods: Motion filtering, Multi-ROI, Detrending, Adaptive bandpass, Smoothing, Outlier rejection, QA
- Finding: Multi-ROI (forehead + both cheeks averaging) showed 10.4% preliminary improvement
- Decision: Implement Multi-ROI for full validation

Iteration 2 (Multi-ROI Implementation - Haar Cascade + Multi-ROI):
- MAE: 4.51 BPM (baseline 4.57) ‚Üí -1.3% improvement
- RMSE: 6.79 BPM (baseline 7.99) ‚Üí -15.0% improvement ‚úÖ
- Correlation: 0.365 (baseline 0.323) ‚Üí +13.2% improvement ‚úÖ
- Within 10 BPM: 87.0% (baseline 89.3%) ‚Üí -2.6%

Subject-level impact:
- 5/24 subjects improved significantly (up to 58% MAE reduction)
  * Subject 01-02: 17.98 ‚Üí 7.56 BPM (-58%)
  * Subject 10-04: 9.28 ‚Üí 4.62 BPM (-50%)
  * Subject 01-01: 4.24 ‚Üí 2.72 BPM (-36%)
- 6/24 subjects worsened
- 13/24 subjects similar

KEY FINDING: Multi-ROI provides SELECTIVE improvement - helps subjects with poor single-ROI performance, demonstrates robustness gains (RMSE -15%) rather than universal accuracy boost.

Iteration 3 (MediaPipe Face Detection - IN PROGRESS):
- Implementation: Complete (MediaPipe Face Mesh with 468 landmarks for precise ROI positioning)
- Evaluation: Running (started Oct 2, expected to complete later)
- Expected benefit: 10-20% improvement over Haar Cascade due to accurate landmark detection

METHODOLOGY STRENGTHS:
- Systematic iterative approach (not ad-hoc tweaking)
- Evidence-based decision making (ablation study to isolate effects)
- Complete documentation and reproducibility
- Honest reporting (positive AND negative results)
- Two-stage validation strategy planned (PURE for development, UBFC for real-world validation)

COMPARISON WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART:
- Our results: 4.51 BPM MAE, 0.365 correlation
- Published POS: 2-3 BPM MAE, 0.85-0.90 correlation
- Gap exists due to: simplified face detection (Haar vs better methods), no illumination normalization, implementation differences
- Gap is closing: Baseline 4.57 ‚Üí Multi-ROI 4.51 ‚Üí MediaPipe (expected 3.5-4.0) ‚Üí Future enhancements (target < 3.0)

I need you to write the ABSTRACT (250-300 words) in academic style for an undergraduate capstone report.

Include:
- Problem: rPPG accuracy varies, need systematic improvement approach
- Methodology: Iterative testing with ablation study, Multi-ROI spatial averaging
- Key Results: 1.3% MAE reduction, 15% RMSE improvement, 13% correlation improvement
- Key Finding: Selective improvements demonstrate robustness enhancement rather than universal accuracy boost
- Significance: Systematic methodology validated, framework established for continuous improvement
- Future Work: MediaPipe evaluation ongoing, adaptive ROI selection recommended

Tone: Academic, technical but clear, suitable for engineering capstone
Focus: Emphasize methodology and robustness improvements (RMSE, correlation) alongside accuracy

- ROI: Single forehead region (upper 40% of detected face)
- Signal processing:
  * RGB extraction and normalization
  * POS projection (R-G, R+G-2B planes)
  * Butterworth bandpass filter (0.7-3.0 Hz, 42-180 BPM)
  * FFT-based heart rate estimation
- Window size: 300 frames (10 seconds at 30 FPS)

3.3 Evaluation Protocol
- Metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE, Pearson correlation, Within-X-BPM percentages

- Left cheek: 40-70% vertical, 0-40% horizontal
- Right cheek: 40-70% vertical, 60-100% horizontal
- Signal averaging: Mean RGB across all valid regions
- Rationale: Spatial redundancy reduces local artifacts, improves robustness

3.6 Advanced Face Detection (Iteration 3 - In Progress)
- MediaPipe Face Mesh integration (468 landmarks)

- 5/24 subjects with MAE > 9 BPM need investigation
- Hypothesis: Single ROI vulnerable to local artifacts and poor face detection

4.3 Ablation Study Results (Iteration 1)
- Tested 7 methods independently on 10 subjects
- Multi-ROI showed strongest preliminary improvement (10.4%)
- Other methods showed minimal or no effect
- Evidence-based selection of Multi-ROI for full validation

Use tables extensively. Explain what each result means, not just numbers.
```

### For Discussion

```
Write the DISCUSSION chapter (4-5 pages).

Address these key points:

5.1 Interpretation of Multi-ROI Results
- Why overall MAE improvement was modest (1.3%)
- Why RMSE and correlation improvements were significant (15%, 13%)
- The selective improvement pattern: Multi-ROI as robustness enhancement, not universal accuracy boost
- Spatial averaging helps worst-case scenarios more than average cases

5.2 Why Multi-ROI Helped Some Subjects But Not Others
- Subjects with poor forehead signal benefited greatly (up to 58% improvement)
- Subjects with good forehead signal saw no benefit or slight degradation
- Subjects where cheeks were poorly detected worsened
- Implication: Need for adaptive ROI selection based on signal quality

5.3 Limitations of Haar Cascade Face Detection
- Primitive compared to modern methods
- Poor landmark localization affects cheek ROI positioning
- Explains why some subjects worsened with Multi-ROI
- MediaPipe expected to address this (precise 468-point landmarks)

5.4 Comparison with Published Benchmarks
- Our 4.51 BPM vs published 2-3 BPM for POS
- Gap attributable to: face detection quality, no illumination normalization, simplified implementation
- Gap is addressable with known techniques

5.5 Methodological Strengths
- Systematic approach superior to ad-hoc tuning
- Ablation study properly isolated variable effects
- Complete documentation enables reproducibility
- Honest reporting of negative results demonstrates rigor

5.6 Limitations and Threats to Validity
- Single dataset (PURE) - controlled conditions only
- Haven't validated on realistic scenarios (UBFC planned)
- MediaPipe evaluation incomplete
- No adaptive methods implemented yet

5.7 Implications for Practice
- Multi-ROI should be combined with signal quality assessment
- Adaptive ROI selection is the logical next step
- Framework established for continuous improvement

Be critical and analytical. Explain WHY, not just WHAT.
